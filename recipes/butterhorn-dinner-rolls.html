  <h1>Butterhorn Dinner Rolls</h1>
  
  <p>Butterhorn dinner rolls date all the way back to colonial times,<br>
    but I've streamlined the process to make this recipe easier for new and inexperienced bakers.<br>
    These classic dinner rolls are light but rich, and slightly sweet.<br>
    They're perfect for special occasions or holiday dinners,<br>
    alongside any main course.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
  <p>Sprinkle yeast onto warm water. Stir gently and let sit until foamy and frothy,<br> 
    15 to 20 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
  <p>While the yeast is proofing, place butter in a saucepan with milk and white sugar.<br>
    Turn heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter melts and sugar dissolves, <br> 
    3 to 4 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
  <p>Remove from the heat and pour into a large mixing bowl;<br> 
    let cool until just very warm to the touch and about 120 degrees F (49 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
  <p>Add 3 cups flour, kosher salt, yeast mixture, and egg;<br> 
    mix gently with a spatula until it all comes together and forms a very thick and wet batter.<br> 
    Add remaining 3/4 cup flour and mix with your fingers, incorporating just the amount of flour you need,<br> 
    until dough comes together into a soft, sticky ball.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
  <p>Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
  <p>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
  <p>Grease the bowl with butter. Place the dough back into the bowl, cover, and let rise for 30 minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as Silpat®).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 9</strong></p>
  <p>Transfer dough back to a work surface and press it into a 1-inch thick circle.<br> 
    Flip over and continue pressing until circle is 1/2-inch thick;<br> 
    use a rolling pin if needed to achieve correct thickness.<br> 
    Use a pizza tool to cut dough into 12 equal wedges.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 10</strong></p>
  <p>Starting at the larger end of one wedge, roll toward the point,<br> 
    stretching the ends of the dough out for the first few inches. Pinch and press the point into the dough to seal and place,<br> 
    seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 11</strong></p>
  <p>Let rolls sit until they puff up a little, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 12</strong></p>
  <p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cooked through and just starting to turn a light golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 13</strong></p>
  <p>Remove from the oven and immediately brush hot rolls with melted butter. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. </p>
